# Programs

This section of the repository is for .exe programs and .dll references. There are some requirements before posting in this section.

### Adding your program to our github

We ask that you make a subfolder in Programs with your project name and then upload it to there. We also ask that you make another folder within that folder named "Source" that way others can check it for things such as viruses or maybe to improve it.

### Some tips

It is best to use C# when making your program, because this is what plugins and Unity uses for their scripts. You can get Visual Studio Community 2019 to help you.

### What kind of programs?

We are looking for programs that might help a player install a concept that has been made using shortcuts. That way people can get to try out some of these concepts for themselves.

You can also make plugins for this section that are for concepts!
